# Bifurcations-in-a-Model-of-Decision-Making-
Bifurcations in a Model of Decision Making using python  
This session aims to introduce you to stability analysis and bifurcations in a model of decision 
making in the brain. The practical is split into three parts, which take you through the steps to simulate  
and analyse the Wong-Wang model of decision making. The parts are outlined below:   
(i) Simulating decision-making in the brain --decision jypyter notebook
(ii) Stability analysis of the undecided steady state; how are decisions forced?--Undecided jupyter notebook
(iii) Bifurcation analysis of decision making and working memory in neurodegeneration -- Burfication analysis notebook
